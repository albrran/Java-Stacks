    <h2>What is a Stack?</h2>
    <p>
        A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It can be thought of as a collection of elements, much like a stack of plates or books. In a stack, elements are added or removed from the top, and the most recently added item is the first to be removed. Stacks have two primary operations: "push," which adds an item to the top of the stack, and "pop," which removes the top item.
    </p>
    <h2>Functions of Stacks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>push(): This operation is used to add an element to the top of the stack.</li>
        <li>pop(): This operation removes and returns the top element from the stack.</li>
        <li>peek(): It allows you to view the top element without removing it.</li>
        <li>isEmpty(): A function to check if the stack is empty.</li>
        <li>size(): Returns the number of elements currently in the stack.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Practical Uses of Stacks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Function Call Stack: Stacks are used to manage function calls in programming languages, ensuring that the last-called function is the first one to return (LIFO order).</li>
        <li>Undo/Redo Functionality: Stacks are employed to implement undo and redo features in software applications.</li>
        <li>Expression Evaluation: Stacks help evaluate arithmetic expressions, such as those in calculators, by converting infix expressions to postfix notation and then using a stack to evaluate them.</li>
        <li>Browser History: Stacks can store the history of visited web pages, allowing users to navigate backward and forward through their browsing history.</li>
        <li>Backtracking Algorithms: Stacks are useful in algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) for solving problems like maze solving, pathfinding, and game solving.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Examples of Stacks Being Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Balanced Parentheses Checking: Stacks are used to check if a given expression has balanced parentheses, braces, or brackets.</li>
        <li>Browser Back Button: When you press the back button in your web browser, it uses a stack to track the pages you've visited.</li>
        <li>Text Editors Undo/Redo: Text editors often use stacks to implement undo and redo functionality for editing operations.</li>
        <li>Function Call Stack in Programming: When you call functions in a programming language, the call stack keeps track of the order of function calls and their return points.</li>
        <li>Calculator Operations: Stacks are used to perform calculations in reverse Polish notation (RPN) calculators.</li>
    </ul>
